+ Building GTK+ version(Compiling)
	
	To build you will need:
	 - libgtk+1.2
	 - libX11 > 3.0
	 - imlib and it's dependencies
	* For Debian 3.0(or above) users: The following command should get all you need to build:
	
	$ apt-get install libgtk1.2-dev imlib-dev xlibs-dev
	

+ Building text version(Compiling)

	To build you need:
	 - libg2-dev >= 0.49

	To link you need the following libs:
	 - libgd2 >= 2.0 (libgd needs libXpm and libfreetype)
	 - libc6
	 - libm
	 - libX11 ( > 3.0 should be fine i think, i tested with >= 4.0)
	 - libpng >= 1.0
	 - libjpeg6b >= 6
 	
	A if you have a standard distribution installed you should already have:
 	- libc6
 	- libm
	- libz
 	- libX11

	 * If you cannot get in any other place, libgd2 and libg2 
	may be at(respectively). Other libs are easyly found on the web:

	http://vkcorp.org/download/gd2.tar.gz
	http://vkcorp.org/download/g2.tar.gz

	 * For Debian 3.0(or above) users: The following command should get all you need to build
	my program (including the other libs, libgd2 depends on them all):

	 $ apt-get install libg2-dev libgd2
