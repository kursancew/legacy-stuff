Description:
 An utility to convert .sav files from the Game Boy (tm) camera
 to other formats. So far it suports xpm, png and jpeg.

+ USAGE
	The interface is quite simple. Open a file and than you 
	click convert to convert it to available formats.
    
+ THE COMMENTS FILE

	The syntax for the comments file is:

	 PIC_NUM=comment

	The condition is:
	 0 <= PIC_NUM <= 30

	 If PIC_NUM is 0 then comment will be assigned to gameface.
	There is an example called comments.txt
	
+ THE PALETTE OPTIONS
	The arguments for -R, -G and -B options are formatted like this:
	
	LC:ML:MD:DC
	
	LC = Light Color
	ML = Middle Light Color
	MD = Middle Dark Collor
	DC = Dark Color
	
	All values must be within the range 0% to 100%.
	The % MUST be ommited.
